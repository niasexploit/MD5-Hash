# MD5-Hash
MD5 itself stands for Message Digest 5 which is a widely used cryptographic hash function, MD5 was discovered by Ronald Rivest in 1991. The idea in the MD5 algorithm itself is to take random data either written or binary as input and generate a value for the result. remains as the output.
Input Data / Input data can be in the form of size or length but the output data is ensured to be of the specified size, regardless of the size entered will result in a fixed size of 32 hex digit MD5 algorithm. Example: the MD5 word test is ed6098dc46d504208cd5674f91822d8a and the MD5 letter a is 0cc175b9c0f1b6a831c399e269772661.

#Instructions
To use it, please replace the word "hidayat" in the code with the word that will be hashed using this tool

# How to install it
```console
hidayat@code:~$ sudo apt-get update 
hidayat@code:~$ https://github.com/hidayat-code/MD5-Hash
hidayat@code:~$ cd MD5-Hash
hidayat@code:~$ python DDOS.py
```
then select a code that will be run, because in this tool there are two codes that you can choose, namely the format in decimal or bytes
